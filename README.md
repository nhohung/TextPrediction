# TextPrediction

This is the final Data science project where I knew nothing about the topic and literature material: build the next-word predictor when the user starts with some words. You must be familiar with this function as it is integrated into the virtual keyboard on the phone you use every day. However, implementing it is so challenging. I did a research on the topic of Natural language processing, how to do it, and how to optimize it. Please give it a try here:

And also, I recommend having a look at what behind the scene:

- the processing part (http://rpubs.com/nhohung/NLP_processing)

- the prediction model (http://rpubs.com/nhohung/NLP_prediction)
